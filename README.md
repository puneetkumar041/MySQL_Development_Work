*) MySQL server's Disk utilization

*) MySQL server's CPU utlization 

*) Load on MySQL Server 

### USER management

MySQL server allows us to create numerous users and databases and grant appropriate privileges so that the users can access and manage databases.
The information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, and sys databases are created at installation time and they are storing information about all other databases, system configuration, users, permission and other important data. These databases are necessary for the proper functionality of the MySQL installation.

*) User creation  

*) Grants privileges to Database and to Tables  

*) Resetting Passwords

*) Revoking permissions

*) User migrations

### Archiving 
As the data in MySQL keeps growing, the performance for all the queries will keep decreasing. Typically, queries that originally took milliseconds can now take seconds (or more). That requires a lot of changes (code, MySQL, etc.) to make faster.

The main goal of archiving the data is to increase performance (“make MySQL fast again”), decrease costs and improve ease of maintenance (backup/restore, cloning the replication slave, etc.)

*) Customize archiving script for n number of days
